Steps:

To install in current setup:
git clone git@github.com:nachopitt/dotfiles.git $HOME/.cfg

To create a "config" alias to be used instead of the git command for all git related operations:
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/.git/ --work-tree=$HOME'

To see changes in the working tree
config status

To avoid showing up the untracked files when performing operations such as "config status"
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

To pull new changes:
config pull

To see differences:
config diff

To add changes to the staging area:
config add files...

To commit changes:
config commit

To push changes:
config push
